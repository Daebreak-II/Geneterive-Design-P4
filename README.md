Description:
A simulation of a school of fish, which parts around predators and changes directions together.

Artist Statement:

Goals:
So I'm trying to use the boids to simulate a school of fish, which at first seems to be exactly what's already happening with the original boids. But what I'm looking for is tight, very consistent grouping, entire schools changing direction simultaneously (unique behavior), and schooling around predators introduced into the system (avoidance).
